<h3 id="q1-identify-and-explain-common-and-important-components-and-concepts-of-web-development-markup-languages">Q1 Identify and explain common and important components and concepts of web development markup languages.</h3>
<hr>
<h4 id="q1-answer">Q1 Answer</h4>
<p>Mark-up languages are used to communicate the structure, formatting and relational interactions of a document to facilitate automatic processing by the program that reads it. Typically a mark-up language finishes with the &quot;ML&quot; to indicate that it is a Mark up language. In the case of web development we are primarily concerned with <strong>HTML</strong> (Hypertext Mark-up Language) as it provides the structure behind webpages. Alongside this mark-up language  <strong>CSS</strong> (style/appearance), and <strong>JavaScript</strong> (functionality/interactivity) are crucial tools in the web development process that support the HTML. This is because HTML acts more like a skeletal structure or barebones that a web browser will review first to see if the page is viable before applying styling or graphical elements. Other Mark-up languages related to the web include XML (used for more for describing data rather than structure) and XHTML (combination of XML and HTML).</p>
<p>Below are some key components and concepts of HTML, CSS and JavaScript.</p>
<ol>
<li>HTML</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Elements: define different substructures of the webpage and are written in-between tags requiring both a start and end tag e.g. <code>&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</code>. At minimum the webpage should include elements for the document type, the document itself, header and body to be functional e.g. of tags <code>!DOCTYPE, html, head, body</code>. Additional elements could include but are not limited to paragraphs, lists, tables, links or pictures. see [https://www.w3schools.com/html/].</li>
<li>Attributes: provide additional information about an element and are specified inside of the start tag. For example the lang=&quot;en&quot; inside of the following code block is an attribute to set the language for the html as English <code>&lt;html lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;</code></li>
</ul>
<ol start="2">
<li>CSS</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Rulesets: are the core written structure of the CSS used to modify elements, classes and ID's of the html. They can either be written inside of the HTML document(inline styling) or in an external CSS file (external styling). Rulesets include both a selector, and declaration.</li>
<li>selectors: will target the elements, classes or ID's of the HTML code base and apply style to them.</li>
<li>Declarations: include both the property and property value. Together they represents what part of the selector will be changed and how it will changed.</li>
<li>cascading or specificity: It is important to note that CSS styles html in a hierarchical way. Meaning that certain types of formatting will overwrite others if there is a conflict. For example, a style change to the &quot;ID&quot; will take priority over a &quot;Class&quot; style.</li>
</ul>
<ol start="3">
<li>JavaScript</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>
<p>functions: Reusable code blocks that perform a task, typically loaded with previously assigned variables and operators of different types they will receive an input and return values to be acted up later.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>DOM manipulation: JavaScript will let you access and change the document object model (basically the structure of the mark-up language document) . Modifications to the elements attributes can be affected this way to make the webpage more dynamic.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="q2-define-the-features-of-the-following-technologies-that-are-essential-in-terms-of-the-development-of-the-internet">Q2 Define the features of the following technologies that are essential in terms of the development of the internet:</h3>
<ul>
<li>packets</li>
<li>IP addresses (IPv4 and IPv6)</li>
<li>routers and routing</li>
<li>domains and DNS</li>
</ul>
<p>Explain how each technology has contributed to the development of the internet.</p>
<hr>
<h4 id="q2-answer">Q2 Answer</h4>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Packets - Smaller components of a larger message send over internet protocol. They are designed to smooth over data transfer when multiple users using the network at the same time. otherwise 1 user would have to wait for another to complete the data transfer before another can begin. The decentralization of data transfer is one of the main reasons why packets took off and eventually won out over other systems as the smaller sizes meant minimal losses if a failure was to occur during data transfer. The use of a packet header allows for reconstruction of the data once it reaches it's destination and a packet can have multiple of these. Of particular importance to the packet is the IP address header which provide the address for which the packet needs to reach.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>IP addresses - This is an address for a computer/device accessing the internet. Within a local environment your device is assigned an IP as well as globally by your Internet service provider once it accesses the internet. Sometimes a Static IP is needed and is often obtained by large companies looking to host their own server and provide a consistent domain for people to access. IPv4 and IPv6 are two versions used to address different sites. version 4 has 32 bits of information, contains less memory and is already supported by millions of devices. In 1999 version 6 started to become more prevalent over a concern that demand for new IP addresses would not meet the supply. It is 128 bits of information but it also provides a number of security benefits that IPv4 doesn't.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Reference : https://www.arin.net/resources/guide/ipv6/history/</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>
<p>Routers act as the nodal points for data transfer and will look for the best route to send the data. The process of selecting this pathway for the packets is called routing. Sometimes the packets may need to jump through different networks and the router will consult a routing table to do this before wrapping it in the IP header and pushing it off to it's destination. By being able to handle link failure and re-route packets when networks are down is one of the main reason why routers had such a strong impact on the development direction of the internet. Due to the size, price and efficiency of the router it was also easily scalable to increase the size of the interconnected parts.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To work directly with IP addresses as a destination source is a tad cumbersome on human compacity so the Domain Name system(DNS) helps to resolve that. It acts like a phone book linking a name to an IP address. If the address or domain changes so too does the DNS. It operates hierarchically having the larger domain names at the top scaling down to the smaller sub-domains. Typically once a domain has been found this data is stored locally and referenced first in future instances before going to the DNS to find the location of the domain. The DNS makes it human-friendly for accessing different pages and hence why it was taken up as a mainstay in the current internet model.</p>

<ul>
<li>TCP</li>
<li>HTTP and HTTPS</li>
<li>web browsers (requests, rendering and developer tools)</li>
</ul>
<p>Explain how each technology has contributed to the development of client and server communication over the internet (50 - 150 words for each technology)</p>
<hr>
<h4 id="q3-answer">Q3 Answer</h4>
<ol>
<li>TCP or Transmission Control Protocol is one of the many transport systems used for data across the internet. TCP however unlike the others originated with the the early network implementation to compliment IP. It acts by relaying information back and forth to the server to ensure that all data is retrieved and free of error. note that this connection must be established before data is sent. Once the data transfer is complete it will then be pieced back together in order. This protocol was opted for due to it's reliability over others as early as the ARPNET (early internet setup).</li>
</ol>
<p>Reference : https://scos.training/history-of-tcp-ip/#:~:text=TCP%2FIP%20was%20developed%20in,to%20the%20Internet)%20in%201983.&amp;text=(commonly%20known%20as%20TCP%2FIP,Internet%20and%20other%20similar%20networks.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>
<p>After data is retrieved the hypertext transmission protocol works to read and process that data. It works as the application layer by loading webpages via hypertext links. It also relays information back to the server upon request that could be confidential like bank account , social security or emails. To provide security due to this layer of transmission, TLS was added to encrypt the communication layer thus creating HTTPS. That way if someone was to intercept your data transfer the information they would receive would be nonsensical rather than easy to read characters. Modern system use HTTPS as a standard due to the protection it provides.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The web browser uses the HTTP protocol to retrieve information from the web and display it for the user. The early implementation of the web browser helped to bring an influx of users to the internet to share data and made it widely accessible to all. Shifts in what web browsers have dominated the market was often due to ease of access, speed and what kinds of content they could show. More modern web browsers handle better HTML, CSS and Java for more well designed websites. Web browsers also store information about what is travelled to, site preferences and login credentials. This data storage method is called cookies and is designed to make the experience of browsing the internet an overall smoother and easy time and has contributed to the success of the web browser.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>These three technologies revolutionized the way information is communicated between client and server enabling widespread availability of web-based services.</p>

<hr>
<h4 id="q4-answer">Q4 Answer</h4>
<ol>
<li>
<p>lists - they are a very flexible grouping of data used in python. They are mutable, ordered and and can contain multiple instances of the same variable. They can also contain other data structures within for example a list of tuples. They see common use due to their versatility. You might see a list being used for recording employee names for example because you can change it, add to it and have multiple instances of an employee name.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>tuples - similar to lists, in that they are both ordered and can contain multiple instances of the same variable. Tuples are not mutable however meaning once defined that's it! Typically used in the case of things that should not change for example birthdays or names of the days of the week.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>dictionaries - ordered, changeable and don't allow any duplicates. dictionaries hold entries with both a key and a value separated by a colon. You must call the key to interact with the value. They are functionally similar to a real world dictionary in that they provide meaning to collection of values. Adding a sales price to cars might be a good use for a dictionary.</p>
</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="q5-describe-the-features-of-interpreters-and-compilers-and-how-they-are-different">Q5 Describe the features of interpreters and compilers and how they are different.</h3>
<hr>
<h4 id="q5-answer">Q5 Answer</h4>
<p>Interpreters execute code line by line in real-time. They don't require an executable file and provide immediate feedback for errors. Where they fall down is in their slower execution speeds. The code is essentially translated 1 line at a time into machine language to communicate with the computer that then executes the code and provides feedback.</p>
<p>Compilers on the other hand will translate the entire code before running. This makes the running of the code smoother but provides less support for error handling. Typically you would expect that an interpreter would be used in favour of a compiler during the development phase but this isn't always the case. It largely depends on the overall performance needs and the programming language being used.</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="q6-identify-two-commonly-used-programming-languages-and-explain-the-benefits-and-drawbacks-of-each">Q6 Identify TWO commonly used programming languages and explain the benefits and drawbacks of each.</h3>
<hr>
<h4 id="q6-answer">Q6 Answer</h4>
<p>Python was designed to be simple and easy to encourage new user development. This has allowed an extensive library of modules and functions to be developed to help support it's use. Due to this simplicity the development cycle is also quicker than most. It also has strong support from a large community of users and strong compatibility across different user platforms (Mac,PC etc).<br>
There are some drawbacks for example, being an interpreted language it can be a bit slower than a compiled language like Java. It can consume a larger amount of memory compared to other programs. Due to consistent updates and changes, version compatibility can also become an issue for concern as well and needs to be managed effectively through a virtual environment.</p>
<p>JavaScript wants to be a platform independent language meaning that that it is very good for running on different platforms and has become the primary language for web development. Being an object-orientated language the layout is often well organised. It also has a large library of built-in functionality for developers to draw upon as well as offering automatic memory management so that developers don't need to manage it manually.<br>
A major drawback of this language is the learning curve being a little more difficult than other languages for entry. Sometimes the code will be a bit lengthier to execute functionality due the need to make it platform independent. Also because it is runs in a virtual environment (JVM) the performance can be a bit slower than other languages.</p>

<p>List of topics containing ethical issues:</p>
<ul>
<li>access to a user’s personal information (medical, family, financial, personal attributes such as sexuality, religion, or beliefs)</li>
<li>intellectual property, copyright, and acknowledgement.</li>
<li>criminal acts such as theft, fraud, trafficking and distribution of prohibited substances, terrorism</li>
<li>GPS tracking data and other types of metadata, MAC addresses, hardware fingerprints</li>

<li>aggressive sales and marketing practices designed to mislead and deceive consumers</li>
<li>trading of shares on the stock exchange OR crypto-currencies</li>
</ul>
<p>For each ethical issue identify a source of legal information relating to the ethical issue and discuss whether the law is helpful in assisting a developer to act in an ethical way. (Word count guide: 200 words max)</p>
<p>Conduct research into a case study of ONE of the ethical issues you have chosen discuss how an ethical IT professional should respond to the case study and how they might mitigate or prevent ethical breaches. (Word count guide: 400 - 600 words)</p>
<hr>
<h4 id="q7-answer">Q7 Answer</h4>
<ol>
<li>intellectual property, copyright, and acknowledgement.<br>
An IT professional is responsible to ensure that they are up to date with current copyright law. Obtain proper licences or permission when using third-party intellectual property. Avoid plagiarism when making new content. Inform the user to the copyright laws surrounding their content. If they become aware of plagiarism they should report it to the proper authority as well. The below website provides information on Australian Intellectual Property laws. It provides an outlet to understand various copyright and design protections. It also lets a developer look at designs that have already been registered in order to avoid a case of plagiarism.</li>
</ol>
<p>reference : https://www.globalaustralia.gov.au/news-and-resources/guide-to-investing/running-a-business/understanding-australian-business-regulation/australian-intellectual-property-laws</p>
<p>Now to look at a case study that involves the issue of stolen intellectual property we will look at &quot;A preliminary mode of insider theft of intellectual property&quot; by Moore et al. In this article we learn about 48 cases to which individuals have entered companies with the goal of stealing confidential information from the org or gaining the urge to do so after working their for a time. The position put forward by the article seeks to demonstrate more so the &quot;why&quot; of the theft and propose strategy to mitigate them.</p>
<p>By taking into account the choices made by some of these thieves, control measures could be put into place to prevent occurrences from happening. For example we learn that in independent cases that dissatisfaction from denial of a request played a role in 33% of them. After a period of time operating in the workplace on a project, team members can develop an entitlement to work produced resulting in the decision to take it for their own. An IP agreement although protecting in most cases where this happens it does not seem to stop it from happening. It is also shown that individuals involved don't take the data directly but rather steal alternative information to blackmail an organisation out of compensation. By striving to keep employee satisfaction high the amount of cases could be mitigated in the long-term. It could also help to keep an employee moving between projects to reduce the sense of ownership over a product and reduce the entitlement factor talked about in the case study.</p>
<p>In times when the decision to steal is pre-meditated to get ahead in the industry we see a new type of model called the &quot;Ambitious Leader&quot;. The motivations of this type of thief lies with the promise of greater rewards. Early onset stages of preparation could include the creation of a side business, Co-ordination with competing organisations or collecting information in advance. It could also be pointed out that over half of all cases downloaded or transferred information outside of the organisation within 1 month of quitting. Siting these methods it would be optimal to keep an eye on individuals behavioural pattern that exhibit a similar trend.

<p>One of the larger difficulties associated with the crime is that if the thief is that if they choose not to use the information right away it can often go unnoticed. It is recommended that It departments use technical monitoring to look out for large data transfers or suspicious activity to mitigate the damages from this type of information theft. Be careful not to take any sensitive or confidential information in this approach and make the team aware that it is happening.</p>

<p>When dealing with trading stocks and shares an IT professional must be transparent and provide accurate data to clients, traders and investors. In doing this it is also important that the platform is following the guidelines and laws that are in place for trading. The Client needs to have a good amount of security set in place for their trading account that includes ensuring that bank information is safe from prying eyes and that unauthorized trades won't happen through their account. In the cases where an IT professional engages directly in trades or helps with the process by provided algorithmic material, it is important that they aren't malicious or manipulative in nature toward the market.

<h3 id="q8-explain-control-flow-using-examples-from-the-python-programming-language">Q8 Explain control flow, using examples from the Python programming language.</h3>
<hr>
<h4 id="q8-answer">Q8 Answer</h4>
<p>Control flow determines how the program flows from one execution to another. By using control flow methods in python the programmer is able to allow the program itself to determine whether it should take action and how many times it should do so.</p>
<p>For example the below if statement takes effect when the information passed through it is greater than 5, but the program will simply pass by if it doesn't meet the condition.</p>
<pre class="hljs"><code><div>if a_condition &gt; 5:
    a_condition += 1
else: 
    pass
</div></code></pre>
<p>Using a loop for control flow will allow for multiple iterations of the condition until we are satisfied that it is complete. the below example will add 1 to a ten times.</p>
<pre class="hljs"><code><div>a = 0
for i in range(10):
    a += 1
</div></code></pre>
<p>Control flow can also be used for catching and handling errors that may appear in the code. The below catches a division by 0 error and returns 0 instead.</p>
<pre class="hljs"><code><div>try:
    a = 5/n
except ZeroDivisionError:
    a = 0

</div></code></pre>

<h3 id="q9-explain-the-difference-between-type-coercion-and-type-conversion-are-either-of-these-used-in-python">Q9 Explain the difference between type coercion and type conversion. Are either of these used in Python?</h3>
<hr>
<h4 id="q9-answer">Q9 Answer</h4>
<p>Both type coercion and type conversion are the process of changing one data type to another. The difference lies within how and when the type change occurs.</p>
<p>Type coercion happens when the programming language itself identifies a required change that needs to happen to make the code compatible and makes it without consent. The classic case of this in python is the interaction between integers and floats. eg. 5 + 5.1 = 10.1. Python has assumed the a change requirement to convert the first 5 to a float so that the sum can be completed.</p>
<p>Type conversion however requires the user to explicitly define that a change to the data type needs to occur. Python has a range of built in functions to accommodate this process eg. int(),bool(),str() etc.</p>
<p>So yes, both are used in Python.</p>

<h3 id="q10-explain-data-types-using-examples">Q10 Explain data types, using examples.</h3>
<hr>
<h4 id="q10-answer">Q10 Answer</h4>
<p>Data types refers to the kind or type of value that is being used in an interaction. The data type will impact whether or not an action can be performed, how the action is performed or if the data can be stored in a specific variable.</p>
<p>Strings for example typically represent text values and are enclosed by quoatation marks eg &quot;Hello&quot;. By adding strings together it will join them back to back &quot;Hello&quot; + &quot;Hello&quot; = &quot;HelloHello&quot;. This is because the + operator also acts as to concatenate a string.</p>
<p>Integers are whole numbers without a fractional part. eg. 5,6,25. If you pass an integer through a print function without converting it to an string the program will fail. This is because print is a String type function.</p>
<p>Floats, like integers are a representation of numbers but they include a decimal part. eg. 5.0,6.1,25.4567.</p>
<p>None is a special data type the represent the absence of value. When operating with functions it is common to see a null type when you forget to return a value from the function. For example if you input the below line of code into python you will receive a class noneType as a result.</p>
<pre class="hljs"><code><div>def test():
    c = 1 + 2

print(type(test()))
</div></code></pre>
<p>Booleans have only two possible values, True or False. typically used in the process making decisions.</p>

<h4 id="q11-answer">Q11 Answer</h4>
<p>An overall class to represent the Restuaurant itself as an entity. Used to encapsulate functionality and behaviour that can be bled down to sub-classes. could also define location and the name of the resturant.</p>
<p>A class for Food. This class would list out the food items that customer could want. It should include a price for each item, what the item is, if it's vegan, vegetarian, meat, if it has sides etc.</p>
<p>A class for the order. It should have an attribute to include the customer name, what table they are on, the food item they ordered, when they ordered etc.</p>
<p>A class for the order management, so that the flow of orders can be managed as well as user input adjusted etc.</p>
<p>A class for the menu, so that the food items can be managed and displayed if currently available.</p>
<p>The Food and Order classes represent the items the customers want. We also need classes that manage these objects. That's where classes like the restaurant, order management and menu classes come in clutch to provide a framework for operation. We could also add additional classes depending on the specificity on which we want to operate including classes for the tables, payments methods, kitchen operation etc.</p>
